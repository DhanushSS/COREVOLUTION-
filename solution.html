  <p>There are many solutions for coronavirus which will work and can save us like mask , sanitizer,staying in 
    home , etc . These may work but it can't be done for all due to poverty and homeless . This lockdown has 
  decreased 20 million members population in India and has brought 75 million members below poverty line . The 
only way to bring it a way is to finish coronavirus but it is not easy to finish it . It can be finished if 
we be united together with government , if we don't follow the government then there are some solutions that 
are done by government to control coronavirus . Even i will say u some things which we can do so we can control 
coronavirus .   </p>

<div class="russia">
  <h3>Russian Technique</h3>
  <p>We may have known that Russia has one of the strongest military country which has defeated Hitler . In 
    this lockdown people were not following the government rules from which they made one thing which the 
  whole Russia followed it and is surviving without a risk .

 The first types is that Russia openend the cages 
of lion from the zoo and left on road with a guardian . When people saw the lion , they went to their home and 
were watching from the window because they know that lion eats the people . They could have left bears as 
their popluation is more but Russia and Bears are friends . They look it as pets and take care of it .

<br><br><br>

 The second one is a small video shown to the people of Russia . We can see in India that Modi is making 
frequent videos to the people of Inida so they can be home and how to respond if there is coronavirus . But our 
Putin made a 10 seconds or less video , he just said , "1 year in Home or 5 years in Jail " . This may not be so 
understanding so let me explain . 1 year home or 5 years jail says that , live in home for 1 year as quarantine or 
live in Jail for 5 years if u are not in home and we see u if u are in road . This is what the sentence says said 
by the President Vladmir Putin .    </p>
</div>

<div class="same">
<h3>ALL TIME </h3>
<br><br><br>
<p> The title say the meaning . It is nothing but the same thing which means the precautions which we do daily 
  such as washing hands , using sanitizer , wearing mask and staying home . If we do this much a take a vaccine 
  it is more than enough as there will be no contact with coronavirus with us so this is what we can do .

<h3>WASTE TIME</h3>
<br><br><br>
<p>The best and efficient plan we can do is waste time . We can do it different ways . The first thing we can 
  do is to make a challenge that who will sleep more . I tried and the result was that i slept 25 hours in a 
single strecth . Before doing this make sure you have said to your parents as they may think u got something 
and you can be woke up in your home or hospital so say and do the task . If u  don't get sleep , see your school 
recorded sessions and sleep , it is more effective . The next one is to take a namkeen packet like namkeen mix 
and seprate it . This makes our time goes very fast and u can get you eye test like how good is your eye to do it 
and can finish your time making u to be in home . The next one is to color plant . If u have a white colored 
plant , u take any color and color it . It takes time and u will waste everything but in last u wasted your time 
so this is how we can waste time .  </p>

<div class="utilize">
<h3>UTILIZE TIME</h3>
<br><br><br>
<p>The best thing we can do rather than wasting time is to utilize time . The one of the best thing is to learn
  coding as this is the only thing which will make our future and which the future depends on . We can learn 
coding from ProGrad Jr or youtube or w3schools.com . You can ask why not White Hap Jr , I will not recommened 
White Hat Jt because it is Chapri and everything which is done there is learnt by ProGrad Jr in 2 weeks . They 
teach us basics but ProGrad Jr creates masters from which I purely recommened ProGrad  Jr . The next thing we 
can do is cooking . You may say that this is only done by girl but by learning cooking you can do 2 things , one 
thing is that you can open hotel or you can show your family that you are worth of something . You can also 
survive in future by living alone and cooking yourself . The best thing you can learn is how to make pani puri 
so you can get some action from it ( you know what i mean ðŸ˜Ž) . The next thing u can do is to clean your house 
. This may be boring but this has one fun thing , u can get to see your old photos and can see ancient items in 
your home . I cleaned my house 3 times and once I got a EAST India Company coin which is from 1729 . This is 
worth of $3000 . I could have sell it but if I wait more , it is worth more than $5000 . The next thing is to 
Be with your family . This is the only time where we can be with our family , when we grow up , it is tough to 
spend time with them , so be with your family and ask them to say their memories from which u can get some 
information and they will be also happy by saying their childhood memories . These are some ways from which we 
can Utilize TIME .  </p>

<div class="ayurveda">
<h3>The Ayurveda Vaccine</h3>
<br><br><br>
<p>In India , a town called Nellore had successfully made a vaccine which can cure the virus in hours. When the 
  vaccine was announced in Andhra that we have created vaccine , in some time all people from all over the Andhra 
  were coming by running or any means of transportation just to take that vaccine . This is how much people 
  believed in vaccine. If we take that vaccine , we get cured in hours . Nellore 90% people took that vaccine and 
  people are not wearing mask when they need . This is sent to ICMR and Reaseacrh Centre to check what is it 
  doing , If it passes the test , Then it sent to all India . Andhra has said that we don't need to wear mask 
  because we have our Ayurveda vaccine ( Maybe a conspiracy).This is one point that we can take that vaccine and 
  can live hapily .
